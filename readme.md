## Manual Build LifeCycle Demo

#### Author: Herman Rabinkin

This repository contains two simple java projects
_heelo util_ and _app_


First of them is library, the latter is executable app
App requeres library as both compile-time dependency and runtime


The aim of the repostiory to show what manual build process
looks like at all main steps:
* dependency management
* compilation
* packaging
* deployment
* run application

And to help students face general problems which could be 
solved with help of build tools like Apache Maven or Gradle


Each of subprojects has several build scripts for unix-like systems
for related stateges (with example of wrong scripts)

Examples are simplified as much as possible in order ot focus on 
stages of build process itself. Shouldn't be considered as example 
of configured build project
